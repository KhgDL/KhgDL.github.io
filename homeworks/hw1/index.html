                Hi, 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm an international student from Vietnam, and I transfered here in Fall 2021 from De Anza college. My biggest love is <strong> FOOD </strong>!!! 
                I love eating, cooking and testing new recipes. I also enjoy gardening or doing things that require creating something with my hands. 
                I spend every weekend taking care of my plant babies, wiping their leaves to make sure they are shiny and dust-free (I know, Iâ€™m a little too obsessed with them).

                <li> I used to think that an eye for design is something that you were born with and pretty much cannot be learned. After reading this article, 
                    I learned that we can nurture that skill. It made me think that maybe pretty much everything can be learned if we put enough effort into it. </li>
                <li> My favorite part of this article were the GIFs. I think they gave me a very different perspective on those websites that I was really familiar with.
                    They also helped clarify and solidify the concepts of studying the apps.  </li>
                <li> My favorite quote was "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product." </li>
                <li> I think I will rate this around 7/10. </li>
            </ul>
