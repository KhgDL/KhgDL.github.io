                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I think these are great design examples. We've learned quite a bit about web design, so I think the way we look at websites are different now.
                                Before taking this class, when I look at a website, I will just think whether it is beautiful or not. However, when I look at a website now, 
                            I will analyze why it is pretty or why it is not, and think of ways to improve it. I also try to think what the intention of the designer was. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I think I like how they show both mobile and laptop design. Even though they are similar in someway,they are very different in terms of how users
                                interact with the app/website. I also love how they are not static photo because it makes it more engaging to analyze. Besides, the topic and theme
                            of each design is very different. Hence, it's a wide range of experiences. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I think I like the easygrow.io app the most. The layout just makes it look really immersive and engaging. 
                                The use of colors is just enough, I feel like it is not too bright nor too light. The color scheme they use is really 
                            pleasing to look at. Overall, it feels like a piece of art more than an app or website. </p>
