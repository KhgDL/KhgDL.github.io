							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Before reading this article, I did not know that there were so many guidelines applied to colors!
								I always thought that it only needs to look pleasant to the eyes. 
								However, this article taught me that there is also a legal aspect to it, which is a brand new concept to me </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think it was the background-to-text contrast ratio. This concept is so new to me and I think it is helpful when deciding which colors to choose and how dark/bright they are. 
								The graphic examples they used also make the concept easier to understand and remember.  </p>
						</li>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
