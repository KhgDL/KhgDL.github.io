					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think there are so many interesting things to learn from this article.
								I never thought that there are so many factors involved in the type decision. 
								I thought it was only for aesthetic purposes, as long as it looks pretty, it's good. 
							    Besides, I like how they link different resources for the readers to refer to. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is the one where they talk about identifying the audience.
								I thought this only applies to the content and not its appearance.
								However, when I think about it now, it's actually makes a lot of sense how the appearance affects the audience.
								Not many people remember to put themselves in the audience's shoes and they just try to do it their way, not their audiences'. </p>
